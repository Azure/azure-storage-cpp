- [How to use Table Storage from C++](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-c-plus-plus-how-to-use-tables/)
- [How to use Queue Storage from C++](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-c-plus-plus-how-to-use-queues)

To accomplish specific tasks, please find the code samples at [samples folder](Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage/samples).

## Getting Started on Linux
As mentioned above, the Azure Storage Client Library for C++ depends on Casablanca. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki/How-to-build-for-Linux) to compile it. Current version of the library depends on Casablanca version 2.9.1.

Once this is complete, then:

- Clone the project using git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-cpp.git
```
The project is cloned to a folder called `azure-storage-cpp`. Always use the master branch, which contains the latest release.
- Install additional dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev uuid-dev
```
- Build the SDK for Release:
```bash
cd azure-storage-cpp/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage
mkdir build.release
cd build.release
CASABLANCA_DIR=<path to Casablanca> CXX=g++-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```
In the above command, replace `<path to Casablanca>` to point to your local installation of Casablanca. For example, if the file `libcpprest.so` exists at location `~/Github/Casablanca/cpprestsdk/Release/build.release/Binaries/libcpprest.so`, then your `cmake` command should be:
```bash
CASABLANCA_DIR=~/Github/Casablanca/cpprestsdk CXX=g++-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
The library is generated under `azure-storage-cpp/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage/build.release/Binaries/`.

To build and run unit tests:
- Install UnitTest++ library:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libunittest++-dev
```
- Build the test code:
```bash
CASABLANCA_DIR=<path to Casablanca> CXX=g++-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
make
```
- Run unit tests
```bash
cd Binaries
vi test_configurations.json # modify test config file to include your storage account credentials
./azurestoragetest
```

To build sample code:
```bash
CASABLANCA_DIR=<path to Casablanca> CXX=g++-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SAMPLES=ON
make
```
To run the samples:
```bash
cd Binaries
vi ../../samples/SamplesCommon/samples_common.h # modify connection string to include your storage account credentials
./samplesblobs            # run the blobs sample
./samplesjson             # run the tables sample with JSON payload
./samplestables           # run the tables sample
./samplesqueues           # run the queues sample
```

Please note the current build script is only tested on Ubuntu 14.04. Please update the script accordingly for other distributions.

## Getting Started on OSX

*Note that OSX is not officially supported yet, but it has been seen to work, YMMV. This build has been tested to work when the dependencies are installed via homebrew, YMMV if using FINK or MacPorts*

Install dependecies with homebrew:

```
brew install libxml2 ossp-uuid openssl
```

As mentioned above, the Azure Storage Client Library for C++ depends on Casablanca.
If you are using homebrew you can install it from there:
```
brew install cpprestsdk
```

Otherwise, you may need to build it. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki/How-to-build-for-Mac-OS-X) to compile it. Current version of the library depends on Casablanca version 2.9.1.

Once this is complete, then:

- Clone the project using git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-cpp.git
```
The project is cloned to a folder called `azure-storage-cpp`. Always use the master branch, which contains the latest release.

**Some notes about building**:
- If you're using homebrew, there seems to be an issue with the pkg-config files, which means that, by default, a -L flag to tell the linker where libintl lives is left out. We've accounted for this in our CMAKE file, by looking in the usual directory that homebrew puts those libs. If you are not using homebrew, you will get an error stating that you need to tell us where those libs live.
- Similarly, for openssl, you don't want to use the version that comes with OSX, it is old. We've accounted for this in the CMAKE script by setting the search paths to where homebrew puts openssl, so if you're not using homebrew you'll need to tell us where a more recent version of openssl lives.

- Build the SDK for Release if you are using hombrew:
```bash
cd azure-storage-cpp/Microsoft.WIndowsAzure.Storage
mkdir build.release
cd build.release
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

- OR, Build the SDK for Release if you are not using homebrew

```bash
cd azure-storage-cpp/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage
mkdir build.release
cd build.release
CASABLANCA_DIR=<path to casablanca> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<path to openssl> -DGETTEXT_LIB_DIR=<path to gettext lib dir>
make
```

In the above command, replace:
- `<path to Casablanca>` to point to your local installation of Casablanca. For example, if the file `libcpprest.so` exists at location `~/Github/Casablanca/cpprestsdk/Release/build.release/Binaries/libcpprest.dylib`, then <path to casablanca> should be `~/Github/Casablanca/cpprestsdk`
- `<path to openssl>` to your local openssl, it is recommended not to use the version that comes with OSX, rather use one from Homebrew or the like. This should be the path that contains the `lib` and `include` directories
- `<path to gettext lib dir>` is the directory which contains `libintl.dylib`

For example you might use:
```bash
CASABLANCA_DIR=~/Github/Casablanca/cpprestsdk cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl -DGETTEXT_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/opt/gettext/lib
```
The library is generated under `azure-storage-cpp/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage/build.release/Binaries/`.

To build and run unit tests:
- Install UnitTest++ library:
```bash
brew install unittest-cpp
```
- Build the test code:
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
make
```
- Run unit tests
```bash
cd Binaries
vi test_configurations.json # modify test config file to include your storage account credentials
./azurestoragetest
```
