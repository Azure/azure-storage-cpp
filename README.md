# Getting started

For the best development experience, we recommend that developers use the official Microsoft NuGet packages for libraries. NuGet packages are regularly updated with new functionality and hotfixes. 
Download the [NuGet Package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/wastorage).

## Requirements

To call Azure services, you must first have an Azure subscription. Sign up for a [free trial](/en-us/pricing/free-trial/) or use your [MSDN subscriber benefits](/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/).

`Install-Package wastorage -Pre`

## Dependencies

### C++ REST SDK

The Azure Storage Client Library for C++ depends on the C++ REST SDK (codename "Casablanca") 2.4.0. It can be installed through [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/cpprestsdk/2.4.0) or downloaded directly from [CodePlex](http://casablanca.codeplex.com/releases/view/146873).

## Code Samples

How-to topics focused around accomplishing specific tasks are available in the [samples folder](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-cpp/tree/master/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage).

## Getting Started on Linux
As mentioned above, the Azure Storage Client Library for C++ depends on Casablanca. Follow [these instructions](https://casablanca.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Setup%20and%20Build%20on%20Linux&referringTitle=Documentation) to compile it. Current version of the library depends on Casablanca version 2.4.0.

Once this is complete, then:

- Clone the project using git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-cpp.git
```
The project is cloned to a folder called `azure-storage-cpp`. Always use the master branch, which contains the latest release.
- Install additional dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libxml++2.6-dev libxml++2.6-doc uuid-dev
```
- Build the SDK for Release:
```bash
cd azure-storage-cpp/Microsoft.WIndowsAzure.Storage
mkdir build.release
cd build.release
CASABLANCA_DIR=<path to Casablanca> CXX=g++-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```
In the above command, replace `<path to Casablanca>` to point to your local installation of Casablanca. For example, if the file `libcpprest.so` exists at location `~/Github/Casablanca/casablanca/Release/build.release/Binaries/libcpprest.so`, then your `cmake` command should be:
```bash
CASABLANCA_DIR=~/Github/Casablanca/casablanca CXX=g++-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
The library is generated under `azure-storage-cpp/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage/build.release/Binaries/`.

To build and run unit tests:
- Install UnitTest++ library:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libunittest++-dev
```
- Build the test code:
```bash
CASABLANCA_DIR=<path to Casablanca> CXX=g++-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS
make
```
- Run unit tests
```bash
cd Binaries
vi test_configurations.json # modify test config file to include your storage account credentials
./azurestoragetest
```

To build sample code:
```bash
CASABLANCA_DIR=<path to Casablanca> CXX=g++-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SAMPLES
make
```
To run the samples:
```bash
cd Binaries
./samplesblobs            # run the blobs sample
./samplesjson             # run the tables sample with JSON payload
./samplestables           # run the tables sample
./samplesqueues           # run the queues sample
```

Please note the current build script is only tested on Ubuntu 14.04. Please update the script accordingly for other distributions.
