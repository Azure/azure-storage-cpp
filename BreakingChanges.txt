Azure Storage Client Library for C++
History of Breaking Changes

Breaking Changes in v7.0:
- Default Rest API version is 2019-02-02.
- Upgraded Casablanca dependency to 2.10.14.
- Raised minumim required GCC version to 5.1.
- SAS returned by calling `azure::storage::cloud_blob::get_shared_access_signature` on a snapshot object only has access to the snapshot, not the entire blob including every snapshots as before.
- Fix a typo in API `azure::storage::cloud_file_share::download_share_usage_async`.
- Fix a typo in API `azure::storage::cloud_queue_message::next_visible_time`.
- `azure::storage::get_wastorage_ambient_scheduler` always returns by value.

Breaking Changes in v6.0:
- `azure::storage::blob_request_options` now accept max_execution_time as `std::chrono::milliseconds`. However, previous `std::chrono::seconds` can automatically converted to `std::chrono::milliseconds`. There can be behavioral change since the precision has changed.
- Resolved an issue where the first forward slash in the front of the blob name will always be trimmed. This would cause blobs with name trimmed prior to this release no longer reachable with the same input.

Breaking Changes in v5.0:
- Dropped Nuget package with name 'wastorage'.

Breaking Changes in v4.0:
- `azure::storage::file::upload_properties` and `azure::storage::file::upload_properties_async` will no longer resize a file, even when properties contains length that is being set to 0 or other values.

Breaking Changes in v3.0:
- Default Rest API version is 2016-05-31.
- Using If-None-Match: * will now fail when reading a blob.
- Rename TargetName for Debug configuration from wastorage to wastoraged.

Breaking Changes in v2.5:
- Upgraded Casablanca dependency to 2.9.1

Breaking Changes in v2.3:
- Upgraded Casablanca dependency to 2.8.0

Breaking Changes in v2.2:
- Upgraded Casablanca dependency to 2.7.0
- Added Microsoft Visual C++ compiler version to user agent string if MSVC is used to compile.

Breaking Changes in v2.1:
- Upgraded Casablanca dependency to 2.6.0
- Added support for Visual Studio 2015, dropped support for Visual Studio 2012
- Separated Nuget packages to wastorage.v120 and wastorage.v140. For backwards compatibility, wastorage became umbrella package which has both packages as dependencies.
- Retired CoApp autopkg. Nuget.exe and nuspec files are used to generate Nuget packages.

Breaking Changes in v2.0:
- Changed behavior to stop stripping out query parameters passed in with the resource URI. Some query parameters such as comp, restype, snapshot and api-version will still be removed.
- Deprecated cloud_blob::start_copy_from_blob and cloud_blob::start_copy_from_blob_async. Use cloud_blob::start_copy instead.

Breaking Changes in v1.0:
- Changed return value type of cloud_blob_client::list_blobs_segmented, cloud_blob_container::list_blobs_segmented and cloud_blob_directory::list_blobs_segmented methods from blob_result_segment to list_blob_item_segment
- Removed type blob_result_segment

Breaking Changes in v0.6:
- Removed following functions:
  - cloud_queue_client::list_queues
  - cloud_queue_client::list_queues_async
  - cloud_table_client::list_tables
  - cloud_table_client::list_tables_async
  - cloud_table::execute_query
  - cloud_table::execute_query_async
- Changed table_entity::set_timestamp to a private method as timestamp is read-only
- Upgraded Casablanca dependency to 2.4.0

Breaking Changes in v0.5:
- Added parameter sequence_number to the following functions:
  - cloud_page_blob::create_async
  - cloud_page_blob::open_write_async
  - cloud_page_blob::upload_from_stream_async
  - cloud_page_blob::upload_from_file_async
  - cloud_page_blob::create
  - cloud_page_blob::open_write
  - cloud_page_blob::upload_from_stream
  - cloud_page_blob::upload_from_file
- The client checks blob lease times and throws std::invalid_argument for invalid lease times.  Previously, this would have been checked on the service
    and azure::storage::storage_exception would have been thrown.

Breaking Changes in v0.4:
- Upgraded Casablanca dependency to 2.3.0
- Changed the exception type in some cases if you upload a blob from a seekable stream but the stream is too short for the desired blob length.
- Used to throw azure::storage::storage_exception in some cases, now throws std::invalid_argument always.

Breaking changes in v0.3:
- Changed namespace to azure::storage.
- The SAS token returned by the get_shared_access_signature functions does not include a question mark (?) prefix.
- The storage_credentials class stores SAS tokens without a question mark (?) prefix.
- Added check to prevent uploading metadata values that are empty or consist entirely of whitespace.
- Removed the constness from the return values of binary_value, datetime_value, guid_value, and string_value functions in entity_property class.
- Removed the constness from the return values of filter_string and select_columns functions in table_query class.
- Changed many functions to accept pass-by-reference arguments or return references as a performance improvement.
- Made some constructors explicit to avoid implicit conversions. This affects these classes:
    canonicalizer, shared_key_blob_queue_canonicalizer, shared_key_lite_blob_queue_canonicalizer,  shared_key_table_canonicalizer, shared_key_lite_table_canonicalizer, 
    sas_authentication_handler, shared_key_authentication_handler, continuation_token, retry_info, retry_policy, cloud_queue_message, cloud_queue_client, 
    basic_common_retry_policy, cloud_client

Breaking changes in v0.2:
- Removed blob_continuation_token typedef (use continuation_token instead).
- Renamed table_entity_property class to entity_property.
- Renamed entity_property_type enum to edm_type.
- Renamed query_payload_format enum to table_payload_format.

Breaking changes in v0.1:
(None)
