Changes in v5.0.0
- Dropped the support for Nuget package with name 'wastorage', now this client library only release with Nuget name 'Microsoft.Azure.Storage.CPP'.

  - azure::storage::storage_exception now has inner_exception populated with the actual underlying exception thrown
  - azure::storage::storage_exception now has more information about errors on storage service side
  - was/error_code_strings.h is added including messages for all possible error codes from storage service
- Improvements on Unit Tests:

  - Unit Test configuraiton file is copied to output directory via CMake now, so no need to copy it manually under Linux
- Several fixes for bugs:
  - Cannot generate SAS tokens for tables with upper-case letters in table name

- No value is set for the server timeout by default, which means the service's default value will be in affect unless the caller specifies a value.
- Added more parameter validation.
- Removed the constness from the return values of binary_value, datetime_value, guid_value, and string_value functions in entity_property class.
- Removed the constness from the return values of filter_string and select_columns functions in table_query class.
- Changed many functions to accept pass-by-value arguments to support move semantics.
- Changed many functions to accept pass-by-reference arguments or return references as a performance improvement.
- Made some constructors explicit to avoid implicit conversions. This affects these classes: 
  canonicalizer, shared_key_blob_queue_canonicalizer, shared_key_lite_blob_queue_canonicalizer, shared_key_table_canonicalizer,
