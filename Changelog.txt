- Added support for Visual Studio 2015, dropped support for Visual Studio 2012
- Separated Nuget packages to wastorage.v120 and wastorage.v140. For backwards compatibility, wastorage became umbrella package which has both packages as dependencies.

  - cloud_table::execute_query
- Updated unit test project and unit test guidance to refer to UnitTest++ in GitHub.

Changes in v0.6:
- Fixed the bug that cloud_blob::download_range_to_stream corrupted downloaded data if retry succeeded after a failed request
- Fixed the bug that cloud_blob::download_range_to_stream might access the target stream after the call completed and led to access violation under a race condition
- Changed waiting between retries asynchronous on Linux
- Changed constructors not intended for public use to private for cloud_blob, cloud_block_blob and cloud_page_blob classes
- Added move constructors and move assignment operators to many classes for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013
- Changed table_entity::set_timestamp to a private method as timestamp is read-only
- User headers in operation context now overwrite existing header values
- Removed following listing functions as they don't work well under a large scale. Please use segmented listing functions such as cloud_queue_client::list_queues_segmented instead
  - cloud_queue_client::list_queues
  - cloud_queue_client::list_queues_async
  - cloud_table_client::list_tables
  - cloud_table_client::list_tables_async
  - cloud_table::execute_query
  - cloud_table::execute_query_async
- Upgraded Casablanca dependency to 2.4.0

Changes in v0.5:
- Default REST API version is 2014-02-14
- Added parameter sequence_number to the following functions:
  - cloud_page_blob::create_async
  - cloud_page_blob::open_write_async
  - cloud_page_blob::upload_from_stream_async
  - cloud_page_blob::upload_from_file_async
  - cloud_page_blob::create
  - cloud_page_blob::open_write
  - cloud_page_blob::upload_from_stream
  - cloud_page_blob::upload_from_file
- The client checks blob lease times and throws std::invalid_argument for invalid lease times. Previously, this would have been checked on the service and azure::storage::storage_exception would have been thrown.
- Improvements on error handling:
  - azure::storage::storage_exception now has inner_exception populated with the actual underlying exception thrown
  - azure::storage::storage_exception now has more information about errors on storage service side
  - was/error_code_strings.h is added including messages for all possible error codes from storage service
- Improvements on Unit Tests:
  - All test cases now print out test name and client reqeust ID
  - Added new cases for containers listing and continuation token
  - Unit Test configuraiton file is copied to output directory via CMake now, so no need to copy it manually under Linux
- Several fixes for bugs:
  - Cannot generate SAS tokens for tables with upper-case letters in table name
  - cloud_blob_istreambuf and cloud_blob_ostreambuf is set to a wrong position after seek() method is called.
  - Content-MD5 header is incorrectly set when sending Put Page requests with page-write set to clear

Changes in v0.4:
- Now supports building on Linux
- Added http_buffer_size request option to control the internal buffer size used in the HTTP layer when downloading data. The default size is 64KB.
- Blob downloads that are interrupted resume automatically from where the download left off when being retried.
- Performance improvement when uploading and downloading blobs.
- Added const version of the operation_context::user_headers() function.
- Fixed incorrect initialization of some members in the cloud_blob_container_properties and retry_info classes.
- Added a default of 24 days for a maximum execution time for an operation
- Changed the exception type if you upload a blob from a seekable stream but the stream is too short for the desired blob length.  
  - Used to throw azure::storage::storage_exception in some cases, now throws std::invalid_argument always.
  - Now checks for this case explicitly before the upload is started.
  - Non-seekable streams still throw std::invalid_argument as before.
- Fixed several bugs, including incorrect uses of std::move and compile-time differences between Visual Studio and g++.
- Added client request ID into log lines.
- Upgraded Casablanca dependency to 2.3.0

Changes in v0.3:
- Changed namespace to azure::storage.
- Added support for secondary location access in Azure Storage Emulator.
- Added support for downloading service stats for blob, table, and queue services to check geo-replication status.
- Added download_to_file_async function in cloud_blob class.
- Added upload_from_file_async function in cloud_block_blob and cloud_page_blob classes.
- The HTTP status code and extended error information are populated when the table service returns an error.
- The SAS token returned by the get_shared_access_signature functions does not include a question mark (?) prefix.
- The storage_credentials class stores SAS tokens without a question mark (?) prefix.
- Added support for accepting SAS URIs to tables and queues.
- Fixed error where table query filter strings containing special characters were not encoded correctly.
- Fixed intermittent error where authentication fails when trying to update a queue message.
- Fixed a race condition causing invalid handle errors when sending parallel requests right after loading the module.
- The ETag is populated on table entities returned from table retrieve operations.
- Changed retry policies to not retry when HTTP status code 408 is received.
- Added check to prevent uploading metadata values that are empty or consist entirely of whitespace.
- Changed the storage_uri class to permit specifying only a secondary URI.
- No value is set for the server timeout by default, which means the service's default value will be in affect unless the caller specifies a value.
- Added more parameter validation.
- Removed the constness from the return values of binary_value, datetime_value, guid_value, and string_value functions in entity_property class.
- Removed the constness from the return values of filter_string and select_columns functions in table_query class.
- Changed many functions to accept pass-by-value arguments to support move semantics.
- Changed many functions to accept pass-by-reference arguments or return references as a performance improvement.
- Made some constructors explicit to avoid implicit conversions. This affects these classes: 
  canonicalizer, shared_key_blob_queue_canonicalizer, shared_key_lite_blob_queue_canonicalizer, shared_key_table_canonicalizer,
  shared_key_lite_table_canonicalizer, sas_authentication_handler, shared_key_authentication_handler, continuation_token,
  retry_info, retry_policy, cloud_queue_message, cloud_queue_client, basic_common_retry_policy, cloud_client
- Major performance improvement when executing many requests in parallel.
- Minor bug fixes and performance improvements.

Changes in v0.2:
- Added sample projects for getting started with the library.
- Removed blob_continuation_token typedef (use continuation_token instead).
- Renamed table_entity_property class to entity_property.
- Renamed entity_property_type enum to edm_type.
- Renamed query_payload_format enum to table_payload_format.
- Minor bug fixes and performance improvements.

Changes in v0.1:
- Initial release of the library including support for blob, table, and queue storage abstractions and providing additional functionality such as retry logic, authentication, logging, and more.
